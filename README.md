Run with main.py

Click an answer for each question and use the Previous/Next buttons or the left and right arrow keys to move through the questions.

Answers automatically save when the program closes. There is no exit button at the end, the questions will just stop changing. :)

Answers are appended to eval.txt. Output file name and display settings can be set as variables at the top of main.py.
